# Timestamp
Random Timestamp Generation and Transformation using Pandas in Python
The code provided is for generating random timestamps, manipulating and transforming them using the pandas library in Python, and saving the data to an Excel file.
The code generates a DataFrame with columns for timestamps, datetime objects, transformed date, and transformed hour. It then saves the DataFrame to an Excel file and reads it back for transformation. 
Finally, it saves the transformed DataFrame back to another Excel file and displays the resultant DataFrame.

#What_is_Timestamp:
A timestamp is a record of the date and time when a specific event or action occurred. 
It is usually used to track and document the sequence of events in a particular process or system. 
Timestamps can be helpful in various scenarios, such as logging activities, tracking data changes, or ensuring data consistency. 
They are often represented in a standardized format, which includes the date, time, and time zone information.
The format of a timestamp varies depending on the context and the system used. However, a commonly used format is the "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS", which represents the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second.
Epoch refers to a specific point in time from which all other timestamps are calculated.
In computing, the epoch time is defined as the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970, at 00:00:00 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).
This point in time is widely used as a reference for timestamps in various operating systems and programming languages.
The epoch time is sometimes called Unix time, POSIX time, or Unix timestamp. 
When working with epoch time, timestamps are often represented as an integer value that represents the number of seconds or milliseconds that have passed since the epoch.
This representation allows for easy comparison and manipulation of timestamps in programming.
